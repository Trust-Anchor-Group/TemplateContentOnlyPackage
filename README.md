Content Service Package
==========================

This repository provides a template solution that can be forked by developers who want to create a custom content-only package for the 
TAG Neuron(R). A Content-Only package contains no assemblies, and does not require restarting the Neuron(R) when installing the package. 
Program logic is implemented using client Javascript and [back-end server script](https://lab.tagroot.io/Script.md).
